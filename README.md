# WFinance

This is going to be a stock ticker app. It ain't even close to done.

# Compiling

You'll probably need to bump up the memory allocation for the node server to have a chance of compiling this. https://stackoverflow.com/a/58863337/3513171 tells you how to do it.

# Adding API Key

Go to `/FinanceAPIConfig Example.json` and replace the placeholder field AlphaVantageKey with your API Key. Then rename the file to `/FinanceAPIConfig.json` You can go to https://www.alphavantage.co/ to create your own.
